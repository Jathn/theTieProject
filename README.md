All code is available in this repository

It consists of two parts:

- Monitor:
  - Map that displays reported maintenance needed. Using image classification the dots are moving from grener to redder with increased severity.
  - Also comes with a simulation to get a grip of what it would look like

- Reporting:
  - What the user interface might look like.
  - All you need to do is put in position and a picture. In the demo, there are however only four pre-classified images which you can choose from.
